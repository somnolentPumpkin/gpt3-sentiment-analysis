# gpt3-sentiment-analysis
This is an HTML interface for sentiment analysis with GPT-3

You can use it from this link: https://somnolentpumpkin.github.io/gpt3-sentiment-analysis/

You need to have your own OpenAI API token in order to use this.

The API token gets stored in your browser's localStorage so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you load the page.

I made this entirely for myself, so it's meant to be functional, not beautiful. :)

Works on mobile.
