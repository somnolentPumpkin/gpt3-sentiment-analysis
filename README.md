# gpt3-sentiment-analysis
This is an HTML interface for sentiment analysis with GPT-3

You can use it from this link: https://somnolentpumpkin.github.io/gpt3-sentiment-analysis/

You need to have your own OpenAI API token in order to use this.

The API token gets stored in your browser's localStorage so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you load the page.

I made this entirely for myself, so it's meant to be functional, not beautiful. :)

Works on mobile.


# How to use
1. Create an account at: [beta.openai.com/signup](https://beta.openai.com/signup)
2. Generate an [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and copy it to your clipboard.
3. Go to the [sentiment analysis tool](https://somnolentpumpkin.github.io/gpt3-sentiment-analysis/) and paste your API key where it asks for an API token.
4. Type in your prompt and submit it.
5. Wait for the result!

**Note:** Your token is stored locally in your web browser. It is never transmitted to me in any capacity.
